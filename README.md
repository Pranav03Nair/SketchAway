# Etch A Sketch Web App

## Overview

This web application features a square grid that is initially set to a default size of 16x16. The primary function of the site is to allow users to hover over grid boxes to change their color, mimicking the experience of coloring pixels on a canvas. Once a box's color changes upon hovering, the color is retained and does not revert to the original canvas color.

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Features

### Dynamic Grid Sizing

Users can set their desired grid size using the **"Set Size"** button. The grid size can range from 0 to 100. Invalid sizes will prompt an alert, and the grid will retain its current size.

### Persistent Coloring

Hovering over a grid box changes its color, and this color change is permanent. The color will not toggle back to the original canvas color, providing a coloring experience similar to using a pen on paper.

## Code Highlights

The site showcases the effective use of event listeners and DOM manipulation to achieve its functionality. The code is optimized for performance and readability.
